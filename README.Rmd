# PackageR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of PackageR is to to help users better understand their package. When developing R packages, it's easy to lose track of the scale of the project. This package provides functions to give developers a better insight into the number of functions, files, and their length. From here, developers can work to identify overly-complex functions or chokepoints and eventually write cleaner code.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ARawles/packageR")
```
